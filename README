This code is a simplistic python implementation of a Web Socket server.

== Why yet another python web server ? == 
Because if you look for simple python implementations on the Internet you will see that 80% of what you will find does not work.

Not because thoses guys are bad programmers but because they all are using the former RFC norm and the handshake will not even pass. RFC norm has evolved and the handshaked is now more secured.

Moreover, a binary network protocol has now to be implemented, including masking / unmasking binary data.

The only web sockets servers you will find that works with the last version of
browsers are some heavy 40-classes implementation... Not really what we can call
simplistic and easy-to-start-with.


== What will this implementation provide? == 
It will provide you with the ability of answering to a client request in text mode without further customization (at least if you do not want to change the code).

It currently supports message-based communication under the limit of the size of 2^64-1 characters by message

It currently supports simultaneous connections handled using multi-threading.

== What will this implementation certainly lack of? ==
Handling network errors properly
You may or may not have problem with non-ASCII characters... I did not have any but I did not extensively test them!
